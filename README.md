# Scripts to export your Photoshop document to a PNG at 2x and 3x
Allows you to keep your sanity and work at 1x. Full explanation and sample PSD files on my blog: http://murdochcarpenter.com/why-you-shouldnt-design-to-retina/.

## To install
Copy and paste these scripts into your Photoshop Scripts folder. On Windows this is *‘\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2014\Presets\Scripts\’* and on Mac *‘\Applications\Adobe\Photoshop CC 2014\Presets\Scripts\’*. Then anytime you want to export a 2x PNG just click **File > Scripts > ExportDocument2xPNG** or a 3x PNG click **File > Scripts > ExportDocument3xPNG**.

## What the script does
- Resizes your PSD to 200% or 300%
- Creates a folder ‘retina’ in the same place as your PSD
- Saves the PNG as documentname_2x.png or documentname_2x.png
- Clears and purges the history (Undo)
- Saves the document exactly how it was before the script ran
